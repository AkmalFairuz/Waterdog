-Layer 7 proxy designed to link Minecraft servers.
+~~[BungeeCord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord)~~ [Waterfall](https://github.com/PaperMC/Waterfall) fork designed to link Minecraft servers.
 --------------------------------------------------
 
-BungeeCord is a sophisticated proxy and API designed mainly to teleport players between multiple Minecraft servers. It is the latest incarnation of similar software written by the author from 2011-present.
+This fork provides native support for the Minecraft Bedrock protocols along with the existing java protocols.
+It is capable of using the ProtocolSupport encapsulation protocol for PSPE support, or it
+can use the native RakNet Bedrock protocol for traditional downstream Bedrock servers such as
+Nukkit, Pocketmine, MiNET, and others.
